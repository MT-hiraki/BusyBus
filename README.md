###### Summer Torres

###### <p>While building my prototype for Busybus I faced many challenges.  The biggest ones were firstly, not really understanding how all the elements would come together and influence each other.  This was due to me still having some difficulty understanding the box model and how to determine padding, borders, and margin sizes.   I would move an element one way and then that element would shift everything else on the page.  I spent a lot of time using trial and error to figure out sizing elements.  Another problem I had was over coding things.  I kept putting things into divs until parts of my code stopped loading.  I forgot something very important that learned.  I forgot to simplify my code and that less is more.  This problem resulted in me having areas of redundant code that I needed to clean up and delete.  In addition I made, I think a successful attempt to add a jquery button function.  It was difficult but I wanted the prototype to demonstrate how users would navigate the app.  Despite the setbacks I faced I enjoyed working on the Busybus project.  With time I am certain that I will gain mastery over understanding the box model and coding.</p>
