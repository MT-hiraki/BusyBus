###### <p>While building my prototype for Busybus I faced many challenges.  The biggest was not really understanding how all the elements would come together and influence each other.  This was due to me still having some difficulty understanding the box model and how to determine padding, borders, and margin sizes.   I would move an element one way and then that element would shift everything else on the page.  I spent a lot of time using trial and error to figure out sizing elements.  Another problem I came across was not being familiar with a wider range of css properties.  I researched css properties that would be helpful in implementing my design.  Once I found what I was looking for, implemented it, something would shift, and I would need to alter the code again.  I think as a result there might be redundant areas of css code that I need to clean up and delete.  In addition I made, I think a successful attempt to add a jquery button function.  It was difficult but I wanted the prototype to demonstrate how users would navigate the app.  Despite the setbacks I faced I enjoyed working on the Busybus project.  With time I am certain that I will gain mastery over understanding the box model and coding.</p>
