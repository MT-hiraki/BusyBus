###### Busybus Summary
###### Summer Torres

###### <p>While building my prototype for Busybus I faced many challenges.  The biggest ones were firstly, not really understanding how all the elements would influence each other.  This was due to me still having some difficulty understanding the box model and how to determine padding, borders, and margin sizes.   I would move an element one way and then that element would shift everything else on the page.  I spent a lot of time using trial and error to figure out sizing elements.  Another problem I had was, over coding things.  I kept putting things into divs until I had so many divs that parts of my code stopped loading.  Locating areas of code that I needed to fix was hard to do.  I forgot to simplify my code.  My punishment was too much wasted time spent cleaning up redundant code.  I did however make, I think a successful attempt to add a jquery button function.  It was hard for me but I wanted the prototype to demonstrate how users would navigate the app.  Despite the setbacks I faced I enjoyed working on the Busybus project.  With time I am certain that I will gain mastery over the box model and simplifying code.</p>
